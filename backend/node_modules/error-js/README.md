Error.js
===========

Tiny Javascript custom error library for both node and browser.

You can use it to load custom errors:

    {
        "NO_NAME": "You should type your name.",
        "NOT_ENOUGH_COIN": "Your coin is not enough, require {0}"
    }

And you store it under:

    /error/login.json

Then use error-js to fetch it.

    Error.require("error.login");
    throw new Error(Error.login.NO_NAME);
    throw new Error(Error.login.NOT_ENOUGH_COIN, 8500);

Error.js has plenty APIs. See [JSDoc](https://kcauchy.github.io/error.js) for details.

How to install
===========

Please use npm to install it

    npm install error-js

If you want to use it in browser, please use

    <script type="text/javascript" src="register.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="error.js"></script>
