register.js
===========

A compatible layer for node projects to support require feature on both browser and node.
Also, provide complex file loading features for browser.

WARNING: Since 1.2.0, "/" as separator is no longer being supported. Dot(.) is the only thing legal.

Usage
===========

Register js is a compatible level for Node.js programs to run under browser
environment. To do this, you should add a single line at the end of your
javascript file:

     var register_js = require("regsiter-js") //Call only once for your entire project.

     //Then you can use it anywhere.
     register(exportObject, "TestNamespace.TestObject", module);

Or if you're not 100% sure register.js has loaded correctly, the following statement
will do 100% correctly under both browser and Node.js:

     var module = require("register-js")(exportObject, "TestNamespace.TestObject", module);

On node.js it is equal to

     module.exports = exportObject;

On browser script, it is equal to

     window.TestNamespace.TestObject = exportObject;

Also, register.js will provide you a require function for browser, which is
almost as the same as node.

     var X = require("TestObject", "TestNamespace.TestObject");

And this tool will try to find a resource named as TestNamespace/TestObject.js.

The second parameter will be regarded as the better browser option. However,
you can write no 2nd parameter as well:

     var X = require("TestObject");

And this calling will find a javascript file named as TestObject.js.

You can set a configuration object as registerConfig:

     registerConfig.root = "http://example.com/js/"

Then the searching file will be

     http://example.com/js/TestNamespace/TestObject.js

and

     http://example.com/js/TestObject.js

Auto-fetch can be useful only when you're running simple websites with limited
visitors or testing. Do not use it for large websites, because performance will
be a serious problem. Use grunt to compile your javascript code into a single file
to avoid multiply loading.

Browser support:

     IE      6.0 +
     Firefox 1.0 +
     Chrome  1.0 +
     Safari  5.0 +
     Opera   9.0 +

WARNING: Since there has been already a npm package named register, so we used
"register-js" instead. For browser, global scope register is also available.

Get JSON
===========

You can use requireJSON for both node and browser.

    requireJSON("test.jsonPackage");

This method will look for test/jsonPackage.json. Also, you can use

    requireJSON.fileType = "js";

To make it work with js files.
