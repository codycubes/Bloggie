var readme = "# Register.js\n\n\n" +
    "Register js is a compatible level for Node.js programs to run under browser\n" +
    "environment. To do this, you should add a single line at the end of your\n" +
    "javascript file:\n" +
    "\n" +
    "     var register_js = require(\"regsiter-js\") //Call only once for your entire project.\n"+
    "     \n" +
    "     //Then you can use it anywhere.\n" +
    "     register(exportObject, \"TestNamespace.TestObject\", module);\n" +
    "\n" +
    "Or if you're not 100% sure register.js has loaded correctly, the following statement " +
    "will do 100% correctly under both browser and Node.js:\n" +
    "\n" +
    "     var module = require(\"register-js\")(exportObject, \"TestNamespace.TestObject\", module);" +
    "\n" +
    "On node.js it will equal to\n" +
    "\n" +
    "     module.exports = exportObject;\n" +
    "\n" +
    "On browser script, it will equal to\n" +
    "\n" +
    "     window.TestNamespace.TestObject = exportObject;\n" +
    "\n" +
    "Also, register.js will provide you a require function for browser, which is\n" +
    "almost as the same as node.\n" +
    "\n" +
    "     var X = require(\"TestObject\", \"TestNamespace.TestObject\");\n" +
    "\n" +
    "And this tool will try to find a resource named as TestNamespace/TestObject.js.\n" +
    "\n" +
    "The second parameter will be regarded as the better browser option. However,\n" +
    "you can write no 2nd parameter as well:\n" +
    "\n" +
    "     var X = require(\"TestObject\");\n" +
    "\n" +
    "And this calling will find a javascript file named as TestObject.js.\n" +
    "\n" +
    "You can set a configuration object as registerConfig:\n" +
    "\n" +
    "     registerConfig.root = \"http://example.com/js/\"\n" +
    "\n" +
    "Then the searching file will be\n" +
    "\n" +
    "     http://example.com/js/TestNamespace/TestObject.js\n" +
    "\n" +
    "and\n" +
    "\n" +
    "     http://example.com/js/TestObject.js\n" +
    "\n" +
    "Auto-fetch can be useful only when you're running simple websites with limited\n" +
    "visitors or testing. Do not use it for large websites, because performance will\n" +
    "be a serious problem. Use grunt to compile your javascript code into a single file\n" +
    "to avoid multiply loading.\n" +
    "\n" +
    "Browser support:\n" +
    "\n" +
    "     IE      6.0 +\n" +
    "     Firefox 1.0 +\n" +
    "     Chrome  1.0 +\n" +
    "     Safari  5.0 +\n" +
    "     Opera   9.0 +\n" +
    "\n" +
    "WARNING: Since there has been already a npm package named register, so we used\n" +
    "\"register-js\" instead. For browser, global scope register is also available.\n" +
    "\n" +
    "# RequireJSON\n\n\n" +
    "Since 1.1.0, you can use requireJSON for both node and browser.\n" +
    "\n" +
    "   requireJSON(\"test.jsonPackage\");\n" +
    "\n" +
    "This method will look for test/jsonPackage.json. Also, you can use\n" +
    "\n"+
    "   requireJSON.fileType = \"js\";\n"+
    "\n" +
    "To make it work with js files.";
